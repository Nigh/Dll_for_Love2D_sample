# Dll for Love2D Sample

It's a sample vs project of creating a dll for love2d.

The necessary libs are included in *.\Project1\Project1\lib*.

Tested in `LOVE 0.9.2` & `lua 5.1.4`.

The *sample* folder contains the lua scripts both for `love2d` and `plain lua` and the sample dll.

*You may need to replace the lua51.dll(luajit version) in Love2D with lua51.dll(plain lua version) for future version of LOVE2D*
